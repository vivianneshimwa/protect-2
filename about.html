            I also do family photoshoot. It makes me happy seeing families come together to take pictures
            and create memories. Seeing families hug and smile in front of the camera is pure joy. I am from 
            a big family that is close and united, everytime I look at our old pictures, they bring back our
            childhood memories. Sweet memories that I can never trade for anything. Family is everything to me.
